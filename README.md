# Northcoders News API

We should create two .env file before we use this server, .env.development and .env.test have to be added first, which helps us to successfully connect to the two databases locally. 

In each .env file, add PGDATABASE=, with the correct database name for that environment. The database name are nc_news for .env.devlopment and nc_news_test for .env.test . 

And check that these .env files are .gitignored.
